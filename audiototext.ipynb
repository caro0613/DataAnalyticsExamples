            "Full text: Yeah done. What's the word. Pink cloud. I was on a pink cloud when i first got here. Then i met my sponsor. Where'd you hear that i heard it through the grapevine welcome it's aa grapevine half hour variety hour featuring the collected voices of alcoholics anonymous i'm don an alcoholic in greensboro north carolina hey don hey everybody i'm sam and alcoholic and palm springs california. How you doing sam your voice sounds very rich and luxurious today i'm going through second puberty it's it it's my voice is changing again yes that's what it is so if i squeaker or squawk at any point you'll know what's going on okay. I'm going through second breakfast. Okay the 11s. Sam dr william d silkworth was director of the towns hospital in new york city in the 1930. During which time bill w have you heard of him. Once or twice. He was admitted on three occasions. Silkworth had a profound influence and encouraged him to realize that alcoholism was more than just an issue of moral weakness. He gave bill the idea. The alcoholism is a disease. He also wrote the doctor's opinion in our big book. I like the grapevine daily quote that came up in my email recently. It's bill w riding in 1957. He says dr silkworth taught us how to till the black soil of hopelessness out of which every single spiritual awakening in our fellowship has since flowered and december 1934 this man of science had sat humbly by my bed following my own sudden and overwhelming spiritual experience reassuring me no bill he had said you're not hallucinating whatever you've got you better hang on to it it's so much better than what you had only an hour ago. Wow only an hour ago that's bill from the book the language of the heart. So you know he had an overwhelming spiritual experience and then he goes i don't trust this. And. Dr silkworth says i don't know either but. You're better than you were an hour it's better than what you've had which is my story. Everyone doesn't get a spiritual experience i didn't have a white light experience but. I wanted to drink cuz i was going to drink or i was just getting and i felt like i was just going to explode. I decided to say a prayer. Which i hit her heard people talk about in meetings i didn't believe it would work but i did it because of that hopelessness. Spirit i had a spiritual stuff they came over me and i made it through that spell. To a meeting. And i didn't have to drink will like 3 days later i'm going now i wasn't really anything i think i was imagining that. And i had. Friend is the minister at the unitarian universalist church. So i made an appointment with her and i describe this thing that happened to me and i said i think. I was kind of imagining it but i you know i don't know i was looking for some kind of confirmation and she said to me. What's the matter with you. I know lots and lots of people who would love to have something like that happen to him and here you are throwing it away. That that kind of gave me well okay i guess i guess that makes sense to me it was kind of the same thing it's like. You're better off. I was better off from that time on and i've been better off using the tools of the program and so now you know i don't question it like i used to but. Even so if i get something that's uncanny i might say it's a spiritual experience i will allow. That is a spear favorite word allow i will allow that it's a spiritual experience. But then a week later i'll go. Nah it was a coincidence so what you're saying is you need ongoing spiritual experiences. Yeah that's what i want is an ever-burning spiritual experience that never goes away i don't know but did you went in your early days and aa. Did you find that things were working and you know this thing what is this aa thing is this too good to be true you know that was about 6 months sober it was the end of the year in 2003 and i was flying with my grandmother to visit family in new mexico and bring in the new year with them. Changing planes in detroit my grandmother and i were in line to board. And about i don't know 10 or 15 ft in front of me on the carpet was this shiny silver disc and i was like well that's going to be gone before we even get there someone's going to pick it up. Nobody picked it up. And i picked it up when i got to it. And it was an aluminum aa 24-hour token. First time traveling sober. And i i've got chills right now. And i had done my homework and found where meetings were in this tiny little town. I knew where i was going to go and i had made arrangements to get to the. I done the work prior to make sure that i was going to be okay on this trip. And that token there just for me was just like. You're going to be fine. Confirmation. Yeah. Yeah that's really cool. Sam what's on the show today. Well today will be visiting with lauren a and following that we will return to our recurring segment blast from the past. We have a recording of nurse teddy-r speaking in 1956 she got sober in 1947 the sound quality on this is not ideal but i've done a lot of work on it so i hope you're going to find it worthwhile to stick with it for 5 minutes. She doesn't mention him but she worked with dr silkworth for a time. She ultimately settled at the knickerbocker hospital in new york. It's the early form of the treatment center you could say back when you were prescribed tomato juice. B12 shots from a giant syringe. In this recording you get to hear the flavor of aa in its first decade or. All right do you have your tomato juice handy yeah i got tomato juice and sauerkraut oh but that looks like bean juice i have to tell the truth i'm having a little bit of coffee and now a word from our response we don't have sponsors what do you thinking no yeah we don't do the commercial sponsor day since the grapevine itself supporting we don't sell ad space in our magazine on our website or in our podcast grapevine doesn't even accept donations from aa members if you want to support grapevine and this podcast visit aa grapevine.org/store hello everyone my name is lauren i'm an alcoholic. I'm from southern california area 5 and my sobriety date is april 1st 1990. Hey lauren thank you so much for joining us. Lauren did you ever have one of those experiences we were talking about earlier. Where this aa thing is working and it's too good to be true and you better hold on to it cuz you got something going on. Yeah well i was listening to you guys and you know i. I first of all had like. Such an intense moment of clarity. Today i finally got sober. I'm sitting on the couch. It was just like some kind of. Something wash. Over. And there was like a new world in front of me and i said let's go to that meeting to my partner you know and he was like okay. But it was very intense but then after that. Everything was. New and better. No matter how painful walking through life was without drinking. Everything just seemed to be a spiritual experience. Like yeah yeah every single thing like. Getting up in the morning and not having a hangover. I went to work every day i ended up having to quit that job very quickly because it was a very drunk place. So everything i did every meeting i went to there was something new that i went. I just wanted to like slap myself on the forehead and go duh. Oh gosh you just took me back to i remember i carried a notebook in those meetings for the first year because i was hearing all these gems of like oh my gosh i'm never going to hear this again this is i've got to write this down things like it time takes time and don't leave before the miracle happens you know those things that we've heard over it over and over exactly i used to go to this big meeting in hollywood california. On sunday mornings and they always had these magnificent speakers. And i was i was not a vision for you and i was just such a mess. And i remember just sitting in the middle of that room and being aghast at how shiny and happy everyone was how mean they were and how these. Some of these speakers had been through more hell than i could ever imagine you know just being like what is going i couldn't figure out what was going on i guess those were all spiritual experiences. You know. Every single time somebody said something that you know told part of my story. You better who they were. That blew me away it was like oh there are people that felt like i. When i. You know that isolation that we have as drunks is the worst part because we get so pitiful and think no one could ever feel as bad as you do. And you're all alone. And then that just disappears when you. Walking to the rooms it's amazing the openness with which we share the disaster of our lives and the fantastic recovery but the disaster of our lives. Remember when i was new. You know i was just full of the gloria say hey and like sharing something with someone like a friend that probably could have been in the rooms and them just like their eyes rolling back in there like what did you do. Oh yeah they told me maybe i shouldn't share this it sounds like you're talking about with that being on fire with aa and everything's a new experience and it's like suddenly having an understanding. Of the way the world works in a totally different way. So is that a pink cloud that i never quite understood pink cloud. People talk about in the. But i think you start to feel better physically. But like i couldn't read the big book because it was all just jumping around in front of me. Later in sobriety up until my 7th year things changed so much and in my 7th year i had drastic change in my deciding to change my career and i finally heard the people in my home group as i complained and complained and complained. Oh you're just supposed to be there to be of service. And get a paycheck. And one day i went in and i was finally of service to people and not telling them that i fixed that and picked up some trash next to a trash can that somebody had missed and i was like oh yeah cuz i was all about me still. And that that's part of the pink cloud you talked about and then all the sudden everything gets real. India the next couple of years and then after that it's like well you better get on the ball here. You know it sounds almost like the progression is pink cloud. Then things get real and. And then we learned where life like a loose gar. So what's your experience working the steps lauren did you get into it immediately yeah i keep talking about this meeting i used to go to. One morning i was there early because my boyfriend at the time we got commitments you know set up and coffee so that we knew we wouldn't drink that morning and. There was a woman there and she said hi to me and i was like. Someone speaking to me and we are still best friends like. She invited me to go to coffee afterwards and everything i mean it was kind of a hips looking cool meeting so you know and everybody knew each other and stuff and it took a while for anybody to know me. She had 6 months which i was like what. And i i started following her and her friends around going places like going to shoot pool and getting a picture of coke. You know how to live without. Right and so i thought oh i better start working these steps and i got a sponsor i started working the steps and this is the most hilarious thing. I wrote my four step cuz they were all doing their four. And my sponsor hadn't told me it's time to write your four step we hadn't even talked about it. Right so i wrote my four step and i called her and she said oh. I didn't know you were doing that well she said i'll come over. So i read her what i thought was my fourth step. And she said is that it and i said yeah. And she said well there's a whole column that you miss. He said your part in all of these things. Fucking read the book completely i didn't know. And it was all about me and how much i hated everybody you know the military industrial complex you know all of all of those things and what have been done to me and it was the most revolutionary and revealing thing she sat there with me and went over every single one of those things. And we found my. That was incredible. Been doing. Like that and i've done a couple more since then. But that experience taught me not just like what my part was but like. To read and pay attention to like figure it out and not try to just be in competition with other people or just try to be what my friends are doing like that was a revelation. To discover that oh yeah to get healthy you have to know your part in all of these as well we need help i think everybody needs help to be able to see it at first what is my part. It's like i was told well you were in that relationship too. You know there was a really important distinction i got with my first sponsor some of these things my part in it was that i was there but there was another layer to my part in it. And it was i'm still holding on to that today and that was something that i needed to look at. Yeah there is a huge relationship in marriage that i had a lot of stuff around. I mean i completely changed my outlook on life but also my opinion of that person. Seeing that person in a completely different light instead of someone who did me wrong. Oh gosh. Lauren and can you describe a transformation of some sort. This person i was speaking of actually called me. I don't know i was maybe 6 years sober. Yeah around that time and he kept calling in my roommate said you know so-and-so called i'm like right. And he said he called again today. Finally this is before we had caller id or anything i picked up my princess phone. Answered it. And it was this person and i had talked to my sponsor about it and she said well here's a chance for you. To get your mens in and if they call and just answer the phone and i was okay. And so there were these long painful silences and i was like this is my time. And i start you know i gave my amends in between him saying no no no no don't say that no no you know and then long painful silences he he said it was the biggest mistake i ever made when we split up and stuff and i was like it must be really hard i can understand how hard it is and. And i appreciate you calling and just saying that and it was it just took my breath away because i had the chance to make amends. He had the chance to try but. You know i i knew that's why he was calling. But he couldn't get it out. And yeah so that's when i had that experience of just changing. The whole perception of this person my whole idea. Of that marriage the whole all of it. Changed and i had much more sympathy or empathy about him and you know it was just. Quite the experience to go through that and i felt. Afterwards that my life was completely different. After that because that was the big thing. That was the big relationship that's why i drank. You know you don't understand. I've been wronged and blah blah you. All that. Yeah and also with my father also. As i grew older i understood him more. He was a soldier and i completely understand why he. When i found out more about him later i mean besides having alcoholism. And i was able to be with him when he he was dying and get make amends what i had made amends before but to tell him he was a good dad and. All that stuff and that changed my life. Same with my mom when my mom. But we were very very close my mother and i were best friends. We will not regret the past nor wish to shut the door on it. Yeah i thought that was just like. It's like a course i regret the past 3:00 a.m.. Crap i am yeah but we can change our relationship to the past so that we're not doing that to ourselves. I love that this is not a guarantee but it is a very common thing in aa that relationships get healed. Lauren what is your recovery like today what do you do to stay sober today and how are you engaged in a what part does it play. Well i most of my meetings have gone online. Man canyon and i are looking for meetings in our neighborhood again to see what's open i just rotated out of being the delegate for area 5. No can you describe what the delegate does for someone who doesn't know what a delegate is. If you have an hour give us a 30 second description. Well i was elected by the members of the assembly of southern california area 5. To be the voice of their group consciences at the annual conference of general service so. I was in conference 71 and 72 71 was on zoom and 72 i went to new york. I was assigned to the public information committee became chair of that did the work with the other delegates there's $93 delegates in us and canada there were some from the east some from canada some from far west is an absolutely amazing thing and then we report back to the conference and if there is something that we want to have them vote on. Let's say the literature committee they want a new. Someone had asked for a new pamphlet. And it went on the agenda and. Literature committee said yes let's do that and then the conference says yes we want that. So you vote on the various items from each committee. And come back and make a report and that's sort of in a nutshell there's so much more that goes into it but no but that's it it's how things get done and aa yeah i mean it's really a protection of the traditions what i was told was. Hold the conference members feet to the fire and make sure you know just pay attention there's a lot of reading and you have to pay attention and if something doesn't sit right you go to the mic and you say my area doesn't feel like that. With the conference does is tells the general service board what to do. Good. Let's go back to how you're staying sober today and. All tied in together. Well i haven't had a drink and a long time. It doesn't seem like a problem for me however. Occasionally it pops in my head. You know and luckily i have the tools. Tubes do one two and three right there. I'm powerless what am i thinking you know i wonder how that wine tast. What do you mean you know that's just so weird. You know our hot summer day to see a billboard what's up with a golden bottle of beer being poured you know that looks good what. You know it won't be good for me that's kind of how i how i look at things now i do go to meetings being in the area in general service for such a long time. That has totally changed my life as far as sobriety goes you know you could never be treasurer for the area and go out and drink. He said he could never could but i mean that stuff all kept me sober and. My sobriety like to another level like i haven't responsible. I was looking for something when i first got into general service in like 2004. Because you know we we've all done this we've made the coffee we've set up the tables we've set up the chairs we cleaned the ashtrays we've swept the floors. And i was feeling like my home group was just. Yeah i don't know i felt dissatisfied the same people saying the same things. Over and over and so i started judging them and then one day i got talked into going to this assembly and i walked in and i was like what is this go inspired. Because we don't think about anything but what goes on in our groups. You don't understand that there is a mechanism that there are people that are trusted servants including trustees that are not alcoholics who devote their time to us. To help make sure that it stays that the movement continues and that it's safe and the traditions i was like blown away so. Basically what i do and i keep getting asked to do stuff so i stay sober. What have you experienced outside of general service. That has been impacted by your experience of general. Okay i must i own my own business. I had no idea how to do the books. And i got elected as the contributions treasurer for the area. So i had to learn how to use the computer to enter things into quicken and then i got elected the next panel as accounts treasurer so now i'm responsible for all the money and i'm learning how to do all of the stuff and print out reports and use excel this is a perfect example of how general service helped me because i use all of this in my business. I'm not good with money and now i can at least see how i'm not good with money. So that's how general services affected me personally. That and you know showing up. Not saying i'm not going to go to the meeting today. I got a headache you know or whatever it is. I think the responsibility of all those things really inspired me. I don't know why secretary i learned how to like make not. I'm not right everything that every single person said every word that they said. In my report. I mean i think that just changes you as a person you know all right lauren is there anything that you did not get to talk about that you'd like. Well i'd be remiss if i didn't mention the pacific region aa service assembly for those of you on the pacific region march 3rd through 5th we are hosting. \n"
